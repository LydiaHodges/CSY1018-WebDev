    <p class="intro">
            The purpose of this site is to look at how websites are designed using HTML and CSS. 
            Using box models and flexbox to correctly place your text, images and videos so it looks more professional.
            I will be reviewing other newspaper sites to look how theyâ€™re designed also how engaging they look. This will 
            be though their aesthetics, content, box model design and uses of advertisements. I will do this in the form of 
            either a podcast or an old school written article. This will also contain all the glossary terms I have learned 
            over the coming months. This will be done in the form of audio. I will be looking two web development jobs and 
            what they involve within the job. I will finally finish this off with a tutorial of different web development 
            techniques. This will be shown in the form of a YouTube video.

                    Hi there!
                    My name is Lydia Hodges and I am 21 years old.
                    I am a gaming enthusiast and my favourite game to play is League of Legends.
                    I love to read books and my favourite author is Paul Hoffman who wrote the amazing book 'The Left Hand of God'.
                    I also love to read anything written by Tolkien. I am currently studying 'Computer Game Development' at the
                    University of Northampton and hope to work as a Software Engineer or work for a big games company at the end of
                    my degree.
