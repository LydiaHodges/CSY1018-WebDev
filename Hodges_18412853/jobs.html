    <p class="intro">
            I looked at two junior game programmers to see what they offer, and the kind of qualifications required. 
            The two I found were a junior programming position at Ubisoft and, a junior engine programming position at Rockstar.
            These will be useful jobs to look at because I would like to work for a large gaming company and make games.

                        The Ubisoft position is lengthier than the Rockstar one. It mentions that I would have to report to the lead programmer. 
                        My responsibilities are being able to work in a team and taking responsibility for implementing software components. 
                        I must use practical solutions to implement feature requests. I must be aware of the technical constraints for systems/features. 
                        I will need to write well structured and clear code, that will use the appropriate data structure and the algorithms. 
                        I must comment on the code that I write. I need to make sure that I carry out the check-ins functionality to progressively 
                        integrate development into the shared code base. I need to test the code with the QC developer when it is appropriate. 
                        I must follow the coding standards, check-in procedures and code reviews. I must show the ability to use the relevant tools 
                        of their job including Visual Studio and perforce. Keep abreast of technology advances within the field. I looked at their 
                        necessary qualifications, this is what I found. I need good C/C++ programming skills. I need to understand game codebase and 
                        its modules, middleware and associated pipeline. Some basic understanding of speed and memory considerations. Some knowledge 
                        of common algorithms, data structures and patterns, and their application. The ability to work as part of a team, the ability 
                        to adapt to change and, good interpersonal and communication skills. I need a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, computer 
                        engineering, mathematics or equivalent; having graduated in 2018 or due to graduate in summer 2019. Experience with commonly 
                        used development tools such as Visual Studio, and source control is a plus.

                        The Rockstar advertisement is more concise than the Ubisoft job offering. My responsibilities are to collaborate with my fellow 
                        colleagues to then find the best way to utilize the software. Then with my fellow colleagues, we must continually develop and 
                        future proof custom solutions in several exciting growth areas. To help diagnose game performances and stability issues, also 
                        refine the technology based around those problems. The requirements I will need are computer science degree or equivalent, demonstrate 
                        experience with C++, good problem-solving skills and good code generalizing skills. Desirable traits that they would like are experience 
                        with peripherals and low-level peripheral IO. Experience with peer to peer networking, low-level network protocols or similar technology. 
                        Experience with file IO and error handling. Self-motivated and willing to get involved in wider areas. Also, a passion for and experience 
                        of a wider range of technology and games.
