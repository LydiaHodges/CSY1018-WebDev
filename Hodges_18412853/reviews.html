    <p class="intro">
        For the reviews i will look at 'The Telegraph' and 'The Washington Post'. These are large newspapers
        that are well known and have millions of readers. The reviews will look at how well designed the websites
        are and what kind of elements are present.

                        I chose the Telegraph because it has a very simplistic design, it has a simple white background with black lettering. 
                        The font is easy to read in both desktop and mobile format. It doesn’t an extreme number of colours and does its job 
                        without the need to be too colourful. The layout has a simple navigation bar, the articles are spaced out nicely and, 
                        it also has its social media accounts on the right-hand side. The only thing I don’t like is where the advertisements 
                        are placed.

                        The Washington post is very similar to the telegraph with its simplicity. Like the telegraph it has a white background 
                        with black lettering. Unlike the Telegraph has its logo in the centre of the page instead of having it to the left. 
                        Like the Telegraph it has a simple navigation system which has the links going in a row. Under the logo it has a nice 
                        little slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness”. Again, it has a simple layout for the current stories. The Washington Post 
                        includes videos as well articles. The advertisements like in the Telegraph are not well placed and can get in the way 
                        of reading the article.
